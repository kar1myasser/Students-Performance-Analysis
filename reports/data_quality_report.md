**Ordinal Features** (11 variables):
- **Age**: 15-22 years (appropriate for secondary education)
- **Education Levels** (Medu, Fedu): 0-4 scale validated
- **Time Variables** (traveltime, studytime): 1-4 scale validated
- **Relationship Quality** (famrel, freetime, goout): 1-5 scale validated
- **Health & Alcohol** (health, Dalc, Walc): 1-5 scale validated
- **Academic Failures**: 0-3 scale validated

**Nominal Features** (17 variables):
- All categorical values match expected domain values
- No typos or encoding issues detected
- Binary yes/no variables properly encoded

**Validation Results**:

- ✅ All nominal features have valid categories
- ✅ No data entry errors detected

#### 3.2 Numerical Variables Validation

| **Variable** | **Range** | **Expected** | **Status** |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Age | 15-22 | 15-20 typical | ✅ Valid (includes adult learners) |
| Absences | 0-32 | 0-30 typical | ✅ Valid (within bounds) |
| Period Grades (G1,G2,G3) | 0-19 | 0-20 scale | ✅ Valid (Portuguese grading system) |

### 4. Consistency Assessment ⚠️

#### 4.1 Statistical Outliers Analysis

**Outlier Detection Method**: Interquartile Range (IQR) with 1.5×IQR threshold  
**Continuous Variables Analyzed**: Age and Absences (only true continuous features)

| **Variable** | **Range** | **Outliers** | **Assessment** |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Age | 15-22 years | Minimal (22-year-old students) | ✅ Adult learners (legitimate) |
| Absences | 0-32 days | Some high-absence cases | ⚠️ At-risk students (legitimate) |

**Domain Expert Assessment**: 
- **Age outliers** (age 22): Represent adult learners or students who repeated grades - educationally meaningful
- **Absence outliers** (>20 days): Indicate at-risk students requiring academic support - valuable for intervention analysis
- **Other variables** are ordinal/categorical scales, not true continuous distributions
- **Recommendation**: Retain all data points as they represent legitimate educational scenarios

#### 4.2 Academic Progress Consistency Analysis

- **Temporal Grade Progression** (G1→G2→G3): Represents student performance across 1st period, 2nd period, and final grades
- **Grade Evolution**: Natural progression patterns with some students showing improvement or decline across periods
- **Zero Grades**: Minimal cases, likely representing students who withdrew during the academic year
- **Grade Scale**: All within expected 0-20 Portuguese grading system

### 5. Distribution Quality

#### 5.1 Target Variable (G3 - Final Period Grade)
- **Mean**: 11.9/20 (59.5%)
- **Standard Deviation**: 3.2
- **Range**: 0-19
- **Distribution**: Approximately normal with slight left skew
- **Failing Students**: ~15% (G3 < 10) - typical for Portuguese education system

#### 5.2 Academic Progress Pattern (G1→G2→G3)
- **First Period (G1)**: Initial assessment of student performance
- **Second Period (G2)**: Mid-year academic progress evaluation  
- **Final Grade (G3)**: Comprehensive end-of-year assessment
- **Temporal Analysis**: Allows tracking of student improvement or decline throughout the academic year

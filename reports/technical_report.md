---

## 2. Data Quality and Preprocessing

### 2.1 Data Quality Assessment

Our comprehensive data quality analysis revealed exceptional dataset integrity:

```python
# Data quality metrics
print(f"Missing values: {df.isna().sum().sum()} (0.00%)")
print(f"Duplicate records: {df.duplicated().sum()} (0.00%)")
print(f"Data completeness: 100.00%")
```

- **Uniqueness**: 100% (0 duplicate records)  
- **Validity**: 100% (all values within expected ranges)
- **Consistency**: 100% (no encoding or format issues)

### 2.2 Data Type Optimization

We implemented comprehensive data type optimization to improve memory efficiency and enable proper analysis:

```python
# Ordinal categorical conversion (preserves order)
ordinal_vars = ['Medu', 'Fedu', 'traveltime', 'studytime', 
                'famrel', 'freetime', 'goout', 'Dalc', 'Walc', 'health']
for var in ordinal_vars:
    df[var] = pd.Categorical(df[var], categories=sorted(df[var].unique()), ordered=True)

# Binary variable conversion
binary_vars = ['schoolsup', 'famsup', 'paid', 'activities', 
               'nursery', 'higher', 'internet', 'romantic']
for var in binary_vars:
    df[var] = df[var] == 'yes'  # Convert to boolean
```

**Data Type Distribution:**
- Numeric variables: 6 (age, failures, absences, G1, G2, G3)
- Ordinal categorical: 10 (education levels, time scales, quality ratings)
- Nominal categorical: 9 (demographics, family background)
- Binary variables: 8 (support services, background factors)

### 2.3 Feature Engineering

We created several engineered features to enhance predictive power:

```python
# 1. Target variable creation
df['pass_fail'] = (df['G3'] >= 10).astype(int)

# 2. Attendance proxy
max_absences = df['absences'].max()
df['attendance_proxy'] = 100 * (1 - df['absences'] / max_absences)

# 3. Overall academic performance
df['grade_average'] = (df['G1'] + df['G2'] + df['G3']) / 3
```

**Engineered Features:**
- `pass_fail`: Binary target (Portuguese passing grade ≥ 10)
- `attendance_proxy`: 0-100 scale attendance percentage
- `grade_average`: Overall academic performance indicator

### 2.4 Outlier Analysis and Treatment

![alt text](image-11.png)

Statistical outlier detection revealed several extreme values, but domain expertise validation led to a **preserve all data** decision:

- **Age outliers (19-22 years)**: Represent older students/repeaters - educationally relevant
- **Absence outliers (>15 days)**: Represent at-risk students - valuable for intervention analysis  
- **Grade outliers (0 scores and high achievers)**: Represent dropouts/severe difficulties - critical for prediction

---

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

### 3.1 Target Variable Distribution

![alt text](image-14.png)

**Results**: 84.6% pass rate, 15.4% fail rate - shows significant class imbalance favoring the pass class. This imbalance will need to be addressed in the modeling approach through techniques like class weighting, resampling, or adjusted threshold selection.

**Grades Distributions:**


![alt text](image.png)


---

The distributions shows a left-skewed pattern typical of academic performance data, with most students achieving passing grades but a significant at-risk population scoring below 10.

### 3.2 Feature Relationships
Key correlations with academic performance:
![alt text](image-1.png)


**Critical Finding**: G1 and G2 grades show strong correlation with G3 (final exam grade), creating potential data leakage scenarios:

**Results**: G1-G3: r=0.826, G2-G3: r=0.918

**Temporal Logic**: G1 (1st period) → G2 (2nd period) → G3 (final exam)

**Solution**: We implemented dual analysis approach:
1. **With G1 & G2**: Represents mid-term prediction scenario (after 1st/2nd period)
2. **Without G1 & G2**: Represents early intervention scenario (beginning of academic year)

**Key Predictive Variables (Non-Leakage):**
![alt text](image-15.png)


- `failures`: -0.393 (strongest non-leakage predictor)
- `higher` education aspirations: +0.332
- `school` -0.284
- `studytime`: +0.250 (behavioral clustering variable)
- `Medu`: +0.240 (weak but significant behavioral indicator)

**Critical Finding**: Past failures emerge as the strongest predictor among non-leakage variables.

---

### 3.3 Visualization Insights

**Key Categorical Analysis:**
Based on the visualizations from `02_eda_visualization.ipynb`, the following relationships emerge:

---
![alt text](image-16.png)

**Finding**: Students with 0 previous failures show median G3 scores of 12, while students with 3+ failures show median score of 8. Clear downward trend demonstrates that past academic struggles are strong predictors of future performance.

---

![alt text](image-17.png)

**Finding**: Students studying >5 hours weekly (levels 3-4) show slightly higher median G3 scores (13) compared to those studying <5 hours (levels 1-2) with median scores around 11-12. ANOVA confirms statistical significance (p<0.001).

---

![alt text](image-18.png)

**Finding**: Students receiving school support show lower median G3 scores (11) compared to non-recipients (12), indicating support is targeted toward struggling students. This creates selection bias in the data where support correlates with lower performance.

---
![alt text](image-19.png)

**Finding**: Clear positive correlation between parental education levels and student performance. Students with highly educated mothers (level 4) show median G3 scores of 13, while those with less educated mothers (levels 0-2) show median scores around 11-12.

---

![alt text](image-20.png)

**Finding**: Absences show a weak negative correlation with final grades (r = -0.091, p = 0.020). Despite the weak correlation, this scatter plot reveals important behavioral patterns - students with high absence rates (>20 absences) tend to cluster at lower grade levels, making absences a valuable variable for behavioral clustering despite limited predictive power for individual grade prediction.

---

**Key Visual Findings from Actual EDA Analysis:**
- **Past Failures Impact**: Clear negative correlation between previous failures and current performance
- **Study Time Benefits**: Students with higher weekly study commitments show improved grade distributions
- **Support System Effects**: School support recipients show different performance patterns (selection bias evident)
- **Educational Background**: Maternal and paternal education levels correlate with student achievement patterns
- **Attendance Patterns**: Absences demonstrate weak but significant correlation with performance, revealing behavioral clustering opportunities

---

### 3.4 Statistical Hypothesis Testing

We conducted formal hypothesis testing to validate key relationships identified during exploratory data analysis. All tests used α = 0.05 significance level.

#### Hypothesis 1: Study Time and Academic Performance
**Research Question**: Does weekly study time significantly affect final grade performance?

- **H₀**: μ₁ = μ₂ = μ₃ = μ₄ (no difference in mean G3 scores across study time levels)
- **H₁**: At least one μᵢ ≠ μⱼ (significant difference exists between study time groups)

**Test**: One-way ANOVA
**Results**: F(3,645) = 15.88, p < 0.001
**Decision**: Reject H₀ at α = 0.05

**Post-hoc Analysis** (Tukey's HSD):
- Level 1 vs Level 3: p < 0.001 (significant)
- Level 1 vs Level 4: p < 0.001 (significant)  
- Level 2 vs Level 3: p < 0.01 (significant)

**Interpretation**: Students studying >5 hours/week significantly outperform those studying <2 hours/week.

#### Hypothesis 2: Past Failures and Pass/Fail Rates
**Research Question**: Are past academic failures independent of current pass/fail outcomes?

- **H₀**: Past failures and pass/fail status are independent
- **H₁**: Past failures and pass/fail status are dependent

**Test**: Chi-square test of independence
**Results**: χ²(3) = 105.44, p < 0.001, Cramér's V = 0.403
**Decision**: Reject H₀ at α = 0.05

**Effect Size**: Large association (Cramér's V > 0.3)
**Interpretation**: Past failures are strongly associated with current academic failure risk.

#### Hypothesis 3: Absences and Final Grades Correlation
**Research Question**: Is there a significant correlation between school absences and final exam performance?

- **H₀**: ρ = 0 (no correlation between absences and G3)
- **H₁**: ρ ≠ 0 (significant correlation exists between absences and G3)

**Test**: Pearson correlation test
**Results**: r = -0.091, p = 0.020
**Decision**: Reject H₀ at α = 0.05

**Effect Size**: Very weak correlation (|r| < 0.1)
**Interpretation**: While statistically significant, the correlation is practically weak. However, absences remain important for behavioral clustering despite low correlation with grades.

#### Hypothesis 4: School Support and Grade Distribution
**Research Question**: Do school support recipients and non-recipients have different grade distributions?

- **H₀**: School support recipients and non-recipients have the same G3 distribution
- **H₁**: School support recipients and non-recipients have different G3 distributions

**Test**: Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric, ordinal data)
**Results**: U = 16,520.0, p = 0.026
**Decision**: Reject H₀ at α = 0.05

**Effect Size**: Small effect (Cohen's d ≈ 0.24)
**Interpretation**: Students receiving school support show significantly lower grade distributions, indicating support is provided to struggling students (selection bias effect).

#### Statistical Conclusions Summary

| Hypothesis | Test | p-value | Effect Size | Conclusion |
|------------|------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Study Time → Performance | ANOVA | <0.001 | F = 15.88 (medium) | **Significant** |
| Past Failures → Pass/Fail | Chi-square | <0.001 | χ² = 105.44 (large) | **Significant** |
| Absences → Final Grade | Pearson correlation | 0.020 | r = -0.091 (weak) | **Significant** |
| School Support → Grade Distribution | Mann-Whitney | 0.026 | U = 16,520 (small) | **Significant** |

**Key Findings**:
1. **Study behavior significantly impacts outcomes** - Students must commit >5 hours/week for optimal performance
2. **Past failures are the strongest predictor** - Previous academic struggles create compounding risk
3. **Absences show weak but significant negative correlation** - Even small attendance issues correlate with lower grades  
4. **School support targeting creates selection bias** - Support recipients show lower grades because interventions target struggling students

**Statistical Validation**: All four hypotheses provide robust statistical validation for our modeling approach, confirming that both behavioral variables (study time, absences) and institutional factors (past failures, school support) significantly influence academic outcomes.

## 4. Unsupervised Learning: Student Clustering

### 4.1 Data Encoding and Preprocessing for Clustering

Before implementing K-means clustering, we performed targeted data encoding focused specifically on behavioral features to avoid bias from academic performance indicators. Our encoding strategy prioritized interpretability and maintained the behavioral focus of the clustering analysis.

#### 4.1.1 Feature Selection Strategy

We selected 6 behavioral features that capture student behavior patterns independent of academic outcomes:

```python
# Behavioral features for clustering analysis
behavior_features = ['studytime', 'absences', 'goout', 'freetime', 'famsup', 'schoolsup']
clustering_data = df[behavior_features].copy()
```

**Rationale**: These features represent pure behavioral indicators (study habits, social activities, support systems) without academic performance bias, enabling genuine behavioral pattern discovery.

#### 4.1.2 Boolean to Binary Encoding

Support system variables were converted from boolean to binary format:

```python
# Convert boolean support variables to binary (0/1)
clustering_data['famsup'] = clustering_data['famsup'].astype(int)    # True/False -> 1/0
clustering_data['schoolsup'] = clustering_data['schoolsup'].astype(int)  # True/False -> 1/0
```

**Impact**: Family support (famsup) and school support (schoolsup) variables transformed from boolean to numeric format suitable for distance calculations in K-means clustering.

#### 4.1.3 Feature Standardization

All features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure equal contribution to clustering:

```python
# Standardize all behavioral features
scaler = StandardScaler()
features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(clustering_data[behavior_features])

# Create final clustering dataframe with standardized features
clustering_df = pd.DataFrame(features_scaled, columns=behavior_features, 
                           index=clustering_data.index)
```

**Standardization Results:**
- **Mean**: 0.0 for all features
- **Standard Deviation**: 1.0 for all features
- **Equal Weight**: Prevents features with larger scales (e.g., absences: 0-93) from dominating smaller scales (e.g., studytime: 1-4)

#### 4.1.4 Final Clustering Dataset Characteristics

**Original Feature Scales:**
- `studytime`: 1-4 (ordinal: <2h to >10h weekly)
- `absences`: 0-93 (count: number of school absences)
- `goout`: 1-5 (ordinal: social activity frequency)
- `freetime`: 1-5 (ordinal: after-school free time)
- `famsup`: 0/1 (binary: family educational support)
- `schoolsup`: 0/1 (binary: extra school support)

**After Preprocessing:**
- **Shape**: 649 students × 6 behavioral features
- **All features standardized** with mean=0, std=1
- **Distance-ready format** for K-means clustering
- **No academic performance bias** in feature selection

#### 4.1.5 Preprocessing Validation

The standardized features maintain interpretable relationships while enabling effective clustering:

```python
print("Final clustering dataset:")
print(clustering_df.head())
print(f"Shape: {clustering_df.shape}")
print(f"Feature summary:")
print(clustering_df[behavior_features].describe())
```

**Quality Assurance:**
- All features properly standardized (mean ≈ 0, std ≈ 1)
- No missing values after encoding
- Behavioral focus maintained throughout preprocessing
- Ready for unsupervised learning algorithms

### 4.2 Feature Selection for Clustering

We selected 6 behavioral features for K-means clustering:

```python
behavioral_features = ['studytime', 'absences', 'goout', 'freetime', 'famsup', 'schoolsup']
```

**Rationale**: These features capture student behavior patterns independent of academic outcomes, enabling pure behavioral segmentation.

### 4.3 Optimal Cluster Selection

**Elbow Method Results:**
The elbow method analysis from `03_unsupervised_learning.ipynb` demonstrates the optimal number of clusters:


![alt text](image-7.png)



**Silhouette Analysis Results:**
The silhouette analysis complements the elbow method findings:

![alt text](image-8.png)

- **K=2: Silhouette score = 0.199**
- **K=3: Silhouette score = 0.234**
- **K=4: Silhouette score = 0.243** ✓ Selected for interpretability

**Decision**: K=4 provides optimal balance between cluster separation and educational actionability. The moderate silhouette score (0.243) indicates behavioral features show natural grouping patterns suitable for intervention strategies.

## 5. Supervised Learning: Performance Prediction

### 5.1 Data Encoding and Preprocessing

Before implementing classification algorithms, we performed comprehensive data encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical formats suitable for machine learning models. Our encoding strategy was designed to preserve meaningful relationships while avoiding information loss.

#### 5.1.1 Ordinal Variable Encoding

For variables with natural ordering, we used categorical codes to maintain the ordinal relationships:

```python
# Ordinal variables - preserve natural ordering
ordinal_vars = ['Medu', 'Fedu', 'traveltime', 'studytime', 'famrel', 
                'freetime', 'goout', 'Dalc', 'Walc', 'health']

for var in ordinal_vars:
    if var in df_encoded.columns:
        df_encoded[var] = df_encoded[var].cat.codes  # Converts to 0,1,2,3,4 maintaining order
```

**Rationale**: Education levels (Medu, Fedu), time scales (traveltime, studytime), and quality ratings (famrel, health) have inherent ordering that should be preserved in the encoding.

#### 5.1.2 Binary Variable Encoding

Boolean variables were converted to binary (0/1) encoding:

```python
# Binary variables - convert True/False to 1/0
binary_vars = ['schoolsup', 'famsup', 'paid', 'activities', 
               'nursery', 'higher', 'internet', 'romantic']

for var in binary_vars:
    if var in df_encoded.columns:
        df_encoded[var] = df_encoded[var].astype(int)  # True->1, False->0
```

**Rationale**: Support services and background factors are naturally binary, making 0/1 encoding optimal for model interpretation.

#### 5.1.3 Nominal Categorical Encoding

For nominal categories, we applied different strategies based on cardinality:

**Binary Mapping (2-level categories):**
```python
# Binary mappings for 2-level categoricals
binary_mappings = {
    'school': {'GP': 1, 'MS': 0},
    'sex': {'F': 1, 'M': 0}, 
    'address': {'U': 1, 'R': 0},
    'famsize': {'GT3': 1, 'LE3': 0},
    'Pstatus': {'T': 1, 'A': 0}
}

for col, mapping in binary_mappings.items():
    if col in df_encoded.columns:
        df_encoded[col] = df_encoded[col].map(mapping)
```

**One-Hot Encoding (Multi-level categories):**
```python
# Multi-level categorical columns
categorical_cols = ['Mjob', 'Fjob', 'reason', 'guardian']

# One-hot encode with drop_first=True to avoid multicollinearity
df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df_encoded, columns=categorical_cols, drop_first=True)
```

**Rationale**: Binary mapping for 2-level categories reduces dimensionality while one-hot encoding for multi-level categories (parent jobs, school choice reason) prevents false ordinal relationships.

#### 5.1.4 Feature Scaling

All encoded features were standardized using StandardScaler:

```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

**Final Encoding Results:**
- **Original shape**: 649 × 33 features
- **Encoded shape**: 649 × 48 features (after one-hot encoding expansion)
- **All features standardized** with mean=0, std=1
- **No information loss** through appropriate encoding choices

#### 5.1.5 Feature Set Creation

We created two distinct feature sets to address data leakage concerns:

```python
# Set 1: WITH G1 & G2 (mid-term prediction scenario)
X_with_grades = X.copy()

# Set 2: WITHOUT G1 & G2 (early intervention scenario)  
grade_columns = ['G1', 'G2']
X_without_grades = X.drop(columns=grade_columns)
```

**Strategic Purpose:**
- **With G1/G2**: Represents mid-term prediction after 1st/2nd period grades available
- **Without G1/G2**: Represents early intervention at beginning of academic year

### 5.2 Model Selection and Implementation

We implemented 6 different classification algorithms with both base and hyperparameter-tuned versions using individual function implementations:

```python
# Individual model functions implemented:
def logistic_regression_base(X_train, X_test, title)
def logistic_regression_tuned(X_train, X_test, title)
def random_forest_base(X_train, X_test, title)
def random_forest_tuned(X_train, X_test, title)
def gradient_boosting_base(X_train, X_test, title)
def gradient_boosting_tuned(X_train, X_test, title)
def xgboost_base(X_train, X_test, title)
def xgboost_tuned(X_train, X_test, title)
def svm_base(X_train, X_test, title)
def svm_tuned(X_train, X_test, title)
```

### 5.3 Hyperparameter Optimization

**GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV Parameters:**

**Logistic Regression:**

- **Family/Social**: 0.105 total importance


**Key Visual Patterns:**
- **G1 and G2 grades dominate** when available (combined 49.1% importance)
- **Past failures emerge as top non-grade predictor** (11.2% importance in early intervention)
- **Behavioral factors cluster together**: Weekend alcohol consumption, social activities, and free time patterns
- **School choice matters**: Institutional factors show significant predictive power
- **Family education background**: Father's education level appears in top 10 predictors

**Key Insights:**
1. **Behavioral Factors Dominate**: Non-academic features show strong predictive power in early intervention
2. **Past Performance Critical**: Previous failures emerge as the top predictor (2.08x more important without grades)
3. **Motivational Factors**: Higher education aspirations are highly predictive (6.5% importance)
4. **Attendance Matters**: Both attendance proxy and raw absences rank consistently high
5. **Social Behavior Patterns**: Weekend alcohol consumption and social activities are significant predictors

**Business Implications:**
1. **Early Warning System**: Focus on students with past failures and low higher education aspirations
2. **Behavioral Monitoring**: Track attendance patterns and social behavior indicators
3. **Family Engagement**: Consider parental education levels in intervention strategies

## 2. Data Quality and Preprocessing

### 2.1 Data Quality Assessment

Our comprehensive data quality analysis revealed exceptional dataset integrity:

```python
# Data quality metrics
print(f"Missing values: {df.isna().sum().sum()} (0.00%)")
print(f"Duplicate records: {df.duplicated().sum()} (0.00%)")
print(f"Data completeness: 100.00%")
```

**Quality Metrics:**
- **Completeness**: 100% (0 missing values)
- **Uniqueness**: 100% (0 duplicate records)  
- **Validity**: 100% (all values within expected ranges)
- **Consistency**: 100% (no encoding or format issues)

### 2.2 Data Type Optimization

We implemented comprehensive data type optimization to improve memory efficiency and enable proper analysis:

```python
# Ordinal categorical conversion (preserves order)
ordinal_vars = ['Medu', 'Fedu', 'traveltime', 'studytime', 
                'famrel', 'freetime', 'goout', 'Dalc', 'Walc', 'health']
for var in ordinal_vars:
    df[var] = pd.Categorical(df[var], categories=sorted(df[var].unique()), ordered=True)

# Binary variable conversion
binary_vars = ['schoolsup', 'famsup', 'paid', 'activities', 
               'nursery', 'higher', 'internet', 'romantic']
for var in binary_vars:
    df[var] = df[var] == 'yes'  # Convert to boolean
```

**Data Type Distribution:**
- Numeric variables: 6 (age, failures, absences, G1, G2, G3)
- Ordinal categorical: 10 (education levels, time scales, quality ratings)
- Nominal categorical: 9 (demographics, family background)
- Binary variables: 8 (support services, background factors)

### 2.3 Feature Engineering

We created several engineered features to enhance predictive power:

```python
# 1. Target variable creation
df['pass_fail'] = (df['G3'] >= 10).astype(int)

# 2. Attendance proxy
max_absences = df['absences'].max()
df['attendance_proxy'] = 100 * (1 - df['absences'] / max_absences)

# 3. Overall academic performance
df['grade_average'] = (df['G1'] + df['G2'] + df['G3']) / 3
```

**Engineered Features:**
- `pass_fail`: Binary target (Portuguese passing grade ≥ 10)
- `attendance_proxy`: 0-100 scale attendance percentage
- `grade_average`: Overall academic performance indicator

### 2.4 Outlier Analysis and Treatment

![alt text](image-11.png)

Statistical outlier detection revealed several extreme values, but domain expertise validation led to a **preserve all data** decision:

- **Age outliers (19-22 years)**: Represent older students/repeaters - educationally relevant
- **Absence outliers (>15 days)**: Represent at-risk students - valuable for intervention analysis  
- **Grade outliers (0 scores and high achievers)**: Represent dropouts/severe difficulties - critical for prediction

---

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

### 3.1 Target Variable Distribution

```python
pass_rate = df['pass_fail'].mean()
print(f"Pass rate: {pass_rate:.1%}")
print(f"Fail rate: {(1-pass_rate):.1%}")
```

**Results**: 84.6% pass rate, 15.4% fail rate - shows significant class imbalance favoring the pass class. This imbalance will need to be addressed in the modeling approach through techniques like class weighting, resampling, or adjusted threshold selection.

**Gradea Distributions:**


![alt text](image.png)


---

The distributions shows a left-skewed pattern typical of academic performance data, with most students achieving passing grades but a significant at-risk population scoring below 10.

### 3.2 Feature Relationships
Key correlations with academic performance:
![alt text](image-1.png)


**Critical Finding**: G1 and G2 grades show strong correlation with G3 (final exam grade), creating potential data leakage scenarios:

```python
print("Correlations with G3 (Final Exam):")
print(f"G1: {df['G1'].corr(df['G3']):.3f}")
print(f"G2: {df['G2'].corr(df['G3']):.3f}")
```

**Results**: G1-G3: r=0.826, G2-G3: r=0.918

**Temporal Logic**: G1 (1st period) → G2 (2nd period) → G3 (final exam)

**Solution**: We implemented dual analysis approach:
1. **With G1 & G2**: Represents mid-term prediction scenario (after 1st/2nd period)
2. **Without G1 & G2**: Represents early intervention scenario (beginning of academic year)

**Key Predictive Variables (Non-Leakage):**
![alt text](image-2.png)


- `failures`: -0.393 (strongest non-leakage predictor)
- `higher` education aspirations: +0.332
- `school` -0.284
- `studytime`: +0.250 (behavioral clustering variable)
- `Medu`: +0.240 (weak but significant behavioral indicator)

**Critical Finding**: Past failures emerge as the strongest predictor among non-leakage variables.

### 3.6 Statistical Hypothesis Testing

We conducted formal hypothesis testing to validate key relationships identified during exploratory data analysis. All tests used α = 0.05 significance level.

#### Hypothesis 1: Study Time and Academic Performance
**Research Question**: Does weekly study time significantly affect final grade performance?

- **H₀**: μ₁ = μ₂ = μ₃ = μ₄ (no difference in mean G3 scores across study time levels)
- **H₁**: At least one μᵢ ≠ μⱼ (significant difference exists between study time groups)

**Test**: One-way ANOVA
**Results**: F(3,645) = 15.88, p < 0.001
**Decision**: Reject H₀ at α = 0.05

**Post-hoc Analysis** (Tukey's HSD):
- Level 1 vs Level 3: p < 0.001 (significant)
- Level 1 vs Level 4: p < 0.001 (significant)  
- Level 2 vs Level 3: p < 0.01 (significant)

**Interpretation**: Students studying >5 hours/week significantly outperform those studying <2 hours/week.

#### Hypothesis 2: Past Failures and Pass/Fail Rates
**Research Question**: Are past academic failures independent of current pass/fail outcomes?

- **H₀**: Past failures and pass/fail status are independent
- **H₁**: Past failures and pass/fail status are dependent

**Test**: Chi-square test of independence
**Results**: χ²(3) = 105.44, p < 0.001, Cramér's V = 0.403
**Decision**: Reject H₀ at α = 0.05

**Effect Size**: Large association (Cramér's V > 0.3)
**Interpretation**: Past failures are strongly associated with current academic failure risk.

#### Hypothesis 3: Absences and Final Grades Correlation
**Research Question**: Is there a significant correlation between school absences and final exam performance?

- **H₀**: ρ = 0 (no correlation between absences and G3)
- **H₁**: ρ ≠ 0 (significant correlation exists between absences and G3)

**Test**: Pearson correlation test
**Results**: r = -0.091, p = 0.020
**Decision**: Reject H₀ at α = 0.05

**Effect Size**: Very weak correlation (|r| < 0.1)
**Interpretation**: While statistically significant, the correlation is practically weak. However, absences remain important for behavioral clustering despite low correlation with grades.

#### Hypothesis 4: School Support and Grade Distribution
**Research Question**: Do school support recipients and non-recipients have different grade distributions?

- **H₀**: School support recipients and non-recipients have the same G3 distribution
- **H₁**: School support recipients and non-recipients have different G3 distributions

**Test**: Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric, ordinal data)
**Results**: U = 16,520.0, p = 0.026
**Decision**: Reject H₀ at α = 0.05

**Effect Size**: Small effect (Cohen's d ≈ 0.24)
**Interpretation**: Students receiving school support show significantly lower grade distributions, indicating support is provided to struggling students (selection bias effect).

#### Statistical Conclusions Summary

| Hypothesis | Test | p-value | Effect Size | Conclusion |
|------------|------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Study Time → Performance | ANOVA | <0.001 | F = 15.88 (medium) | **Significant** |
| Past Failures → Pass/Fail | Chi-square | <0.001 | χ² = 105.44 (large) | **Significant** |
| Absences → Final Grade | Pearson correlation | 0.020 | r = -0.091 (weak) | **Significant** |
| School Support → Grade Distribution | Mann-Whitney | 0.026 | U = 16,520 (small) | **Significant** |

**Key Findings**:
1. **Study behavior significantly impacts outcomes** - Students must commit >5 hours/week for optimal performance
2. **Past failures are the strongest predictor** - Previous academic struggles create compounding risk
3. **Absences show weak but significant negative correlation** - Even small attendance issues correlate with lower grades  
4. **School support targeting creates selection bias** - Support recipients show lower grades because interventions target struggling students

**Statistical Validation**: All four hypotheses provide robust statistical validation for our modeling approach, confirming that both behavioral variables (study time, absences) and institutional factors (past failures, school support) significantly influence academic outcomes.

#### Statistical Conclusions Summary

| Hypothesis | Test | p-value | Effect Size | Conclusion |
|------------|------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Study Time → Performance | ANOVA | <0.001 | η² = 0.069 (medium) | **Significant** |
| Past Failures → Pass/Fail | Chi-square | <0.001 | V = 0.403 (large) | **Significant** |
| Maternal Education → Success | Chi-square trend | <0.001 | V = 0.210 (medium) | **Significant** |
| School Type → Performance | Mann-Whitney | <0.001 | η² = 0.081 (medium) | **Significant** |

**Key Findings**:
1. **Study behavior significantly impacts outcomes** - Students must commit >5 hours/week for optimal performance
2. **Past failures are the strongest predictor** - Previous academic struggles create compounding risk
3. **Family educational background matters** - Maternal education shows clear intergenerational effects  
4. **Institutional factors influence performance** - School choice affects student outcomes beyond individual characteristics

**Statistical Validation**: All four hypotheses provide robust statistical validation for our modeling approach, confirming that both behavioral variables (study time, past failures) and demographic factors (parental education, school type) significantly influence academic outcomes.

### 3.4 Visualization Insights

**Key Categorical Analysis:**
Based on the visualizations from `02_eda_visualization.ipynb`, the following relationships emerge:

---
![alt text](image-3.png)

**Finding**: Students with 0 previous failures show median G3 scores of 12, while students with 3+ failures show median score of 8. Clear downward trend demonstrates that past academic struggles are strong predictors of future performance.

---

![alt text](image-4.png)

**Finding**: Students studying >5 hours weekly (levels 3-4) show slightly higher median G3 scores (13) compared to those studying <5 hours (levels 1-2) with median scores around 11-12. ANOVA confirms statistical significance (p<0.001).

---

![alt text](image-5.png)

**Finding**: Students receiving school support show lower median G3 scores (11) compared to non-recipients (12), indicating support is targeted toward struggling students. This creates selection bias in the data where support correlates with lower performance.

---
![alt text](image-6.png)

**Finding**: Clear positive correlation between parental education levels and student performance. Students with highly educated mothers (level 4) show median G3 scores of 13, while those with less educated mothers (levels 0-2) show median scores around 11-12.

---

**Key Visual Findings from Actual EDA Analysis:**
- **Past Failures Impact**: Clear negative correlation between previous failures and current performance
- **Study Time Benefits**: Students with higher weekly study commitments show improved grade distributions
- **Support System Effects**: School support recipients show different performance patterns (selection bias evident)
- **Educational Background**: Maternal and paternal education levels correlate with student achievement patterns

## 4. Unsupervised Learning: Student Clustering

### 4.1 Feature Selection for Clustering

We selected 6 behavioral features for K-means clustering:

```python
behavioral_features = ['studytime', 'absences', 'goout', 'freetime', 'famsup', 'schoolsup']
```

**Rationale**: These features capture student behavior patterns independent of academic outcomes, enabling pure behavioral segmentation.

### 4.2 Optimal Cluster Selection

**Elbow Method Results:**
The elbow method analysis from `03_unsupervised_learning.ipynb` demonstrates the optimal number of clusters:


![alt text](image-7.png)



**Silhouette Analysis Results:**
The silhouette analysis complements the elbow method findings:

![alt text](image-8.png)

- **K=2: Silhouette score = 0.199**
- **K=3: Silhouette score = 0.234**
- **K=4: Silhouette score = 0.243** ✓ Selected for interpretability

**Decision**: K=4 provides optimal balance between cluster separation and educational actionability. The moderate silhouette score (0.243) indicates behavioral features show natural grouping patterns suitable for intervention strategies.

- **Past failures emerge as top non-grade predictor** (11.2% importance in early intervention)
- **Behavioral factors cluster together**: Weekend alcohol consumption, social activities, and free time patterns
- **School choice matters**: Institutional factors show significant predictive power
- **Family education background**: Father's education level appears in top 10 predictors

**Key Insights:**
1. **Behavioral Factors Dominate**: Non-academic features show strong predictive power in early intervention
2. **Past Performance Critical**: Previous failures emerge as the top predictor (2.08x more important without grades)
3. **Motivational Factors**: Higher education aspirations are highly predictive (6.5% importance)
4. **Attendance Matters**: Both attendance proxy and raw absences rank consistently high
5. **Social Behavior Patterns**: Weekend alcohol consumption and social activities are significant predictors

**Business Implications:**
1. **Early Warning System**: Focus on students with past failures and low higher education aspirations
2. **Behavioral Monitoring**: Track attendance patterns and social behavior indicators
3. **Family Engagement**: Consider parental education levels in intervention strategies  
4. **Institutional Factors**: School choice and environment significantly impact outcomes

**Interpretation**: Behavioral and motivational factors are key predictors even without grade information from earlier periods, as evidenced by the feature importance rankings and model performance consistency. The 5.2% performance drop when removing G1/G2 grades demonstrates that effective early intervention is possible using readily available behavioral and demographic indicators.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis demonstrates the significant potential of machine learning in educational settings. Through rigorous data preprocessing, insightful clustering analysis, and robust classification modeling, we developed a framework capable of:

1. **Identifying student behavioral patterns** with 4 distinct clusters representing different support needs
2. **Predicting academic outcomes** with up to 94.5% F1-score accuracy
3. **Providing actionable recommendations** for educational stakeholders
4. **Balancing early intervention and prediction accuracy** through dual modeling approaches

The project successfully addresses the critical need for data-driven educational interventions while maintaining awareness of ethical considerations and practical implementation challenges. The developed models and insights provide a solid foundation for evidence-based educational policy and personalized student support systems.

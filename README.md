# Student Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data from the UCI ML Repository to identify early warning signals for academic underperformance and provide actionable recommendations for universities.

## Dataset

```

## Setup Instructions

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open and run notebooks in sequential order (01 through 05)
2. Results and visualizations will be generated within notebooks
3. Export final report and presentation materials

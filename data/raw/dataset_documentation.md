# Student Performance Dataset Information

## üìä Dataset Overview

### Source
- **Repository**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Dataset ID**: 320
- **License**: CC BY 4.0
- **Citation**: Cortez and Silva, 2008

### Description
This dataset approaches student achievement in **secondary education** of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school-related features collected using school reports and questionnaires.

### Key Details
- **Subjects**: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por)
- **Records**: 649 students
- **Features**: 33 variables (30 features + 3 targets)
- **Missing Values**: ‚ùå None
- **Tasks**: Binary/five-level classification and regression

### Important Note on Target Variables
‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Leakage Warning**: The target attribute `G3` has a **strong correlation** with `G2` and `G1`:
- **G1**: 1st period grade
- **G2**: 2nd period grade  
- **G3**: Final year grade (3rd period) - **Main Target**

It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful for early intervention.

## üîç Data Analysis Considerations

### Feature Categories
- **Demographic**: `sex`, `age`, `address`, `famsize`, `Pstatus`
- **Socioeconomic**: `Medu`, `Fedu`, `Mjob`, `Fjob`, `guardian`
- **Academic**: `school`, `reason`, `traveltime`, `studytime`, `failures`
- **Support Systems**: `schoolsup`, `famsup`, `paid`, `activities`, `nursery`, `higher`, `internet`
- **Behavioral**: `romantic`, `famrel`, `freetime`, `goout`, `Dalc`, `Walc`, `health`, `absences`

### Data Quality
- ‚úÖ **No missing values** across all 649 records
- ‚úÖ **Consistent data types** and encoding
- ‚úÖ **Well-documented** variable definitions
- ‚úÖ **Balanced representation** across schools

### Research Applications
1. **Early Warning Systems**: Predict G3 using only demographic and early behavioral indicators
2. **Intervention Targeting**: Identify at-risk student profiles
3. **Factor Analysis**: Understand drivers of academic performance
4. **Policy Insights**: Inform educational support programs
